#### Example value to enter for the endpoint /marina?laza= (I recommend you to use postman) :
```
(a&b | c)->d  <->  ~e
```
```
zazavavindrano & zazavavindrano -> 
          ( (~ swim_warm -> red)
          & (blue | ~ red)
          & (live_corals -> ~ eat_shrimps)
          & (eat_shrimps <-> swim_warm)
          & (blue -> (swim_warm & live_corals))
          & (swim_warm -> blue) )
```
